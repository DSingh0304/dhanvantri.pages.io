Let me analyze the frontend dashboards for patients and doctors and verify if the backend can meet all their needs.

Now, let me check what's required in the registration page:

Now let me check the login page:

Let me check the backend controller for patients to understand current implementation:

Read file: backend/src/controllers/patientController.js
Now let me check one of the doctor controllers:

Read file: backend/src/controllers/doctorController.js
Based on my analysis of the frontend dashboards (patient and doctor) and the registration/login pages, and comparing them with the backend implementation, here's a list of the missing or incomplete features that need to be implemented:

## Missing Backend Features

1. **Notifications System**:
   - The patient dashboard shows notifications, but there's no notification API in the backend
   - Need endpoints for retrieving, marking as read, and creating notifications

2. **Health Metrics API**:
   - The patient dashboard displays health metrics charts (blood pressure, weight, blood sugar)
   - No backend endpoints for storing and retrieving these health metrics

3. **Emergency Card Generation**:
   - The sidebar shows "Emergency Card" but no implementation exists in the backend
   - Need APIs to generate and manage emergency access cards/QR codes

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Both dashboards have search bars, but no search API exists
   - Need endpoints for searching across patients, appointments, records, etc.

5. **Doctor Specialty-Based Filtering**:
   - The appointment scheduling form needs to filter doctors by specialty
   - No specific endpoint for getting doctors by specialty

6. **Doctor Time Slot Availability**:
   - Appointment scheduling requires checking available time slots
   - No API to retrieve available slots for a doctor on a specific date

7. **Message/Chat System**:
   - Doctor dashboard shows messages with a badge count
   - No messaging/chat API implementation in the backend

8. **Earnings/Payment System**:
   - Doctor dashboard shows earnings, but no payment/financial APIs exist
   - Need endpoints for tracking consultations, fees, and payments

9. **Registration Verification Flow**:
   - The registration form has a verification step
   - No email verification or OTP verification API exists

10. **Government ID Integration**:
    - Login shows "Continue with Government ID" option
    - No implementation for government ID authentication

11. **Password Reset Flow**:
    - "Forgot Password" link exists but no password reset API
    - Need APIs for requesting resets and processing reset tokens

12. **File Management System**:
    - Medical records can have attachments
    - The file upload middleware exists but no complete implementation for attaching files to records

## Incomplete Backend Features

1. **Patient Dashboard Statistics**:
   - The dashboard shows counts of appointments, medications, lab tests, and records
   - The API returns the full records but doesn't provide summarized statistics

2. **Doctor's Schedule Management**:
   - Doctor dashboard shows a schedule tab
   - The `updateAvailability` API exists but needs enhancements for weekly/recurring schedules

3. **Settings/Profile Management**:
   - Both dashboards have settings sections
   - Basic profile update exists but no comprehensive settings management

4. **Insurance Information Management**:
   - Patient dashboard has insurance section
   - Patient model has `insuranceDetails` but no dedicated API for insurance management

5. **Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Doctor dashboard displays various statistics but lacks comprehensive reporting
   - Need analytics endpoints for patient trends, appointment patterns, etc.

6. **Hospital Dashboard**:
   - Hospital user type exists but lacks dedicated dashboard APIs
   - Need more comprehensive hospital management features

7. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Appointment confirmations and notifications would benefit from real-time updates
   - Current implementation is purely RESTful without real-time capabilities

These missing and incomplete features should be prioritized based on the immediate needs of the frontend implementation. The most critical ones appear to be the notifications system, health metrics API, search functionality, and doctor specialty/time slot availability features.
